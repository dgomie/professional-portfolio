# Professional-Portfolio

## Description

This page was created to act as a landing page for future employers to browse my professional portfolio. It is intended to showcase my coding projects and resume as well as provide methods in which users can contact me including phone number, email, and social media.

On top of showcasing projects, this page was built to further demonstrate my proficiencies with HTML and CSS. During the process of building the site, I learned more about the intricacies of flexbox layouts, and designing for mobile platforms.

TODO:
There are currently placeholder projects in the "Work" section that currently link to my main github account. These will gradually be replaced with actual projects throughout the course of my bootcamp.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Navigate to https://github.com/dgomie/professional-portfolio. To view the updated html elements and alt text for images, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (MacOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.
